This will also require you to add a php file to your pbx server to  accept the incoming request and to make a manager user which you will enter in the php file.

Download PHP File from github named call.php
Please note that your FreePBX server must have PHP installed.

If you installed the native FreePBX distro you are probably on CentOS and need to run this command:
	sudo yum install php
If you are on Ubuntu the command  would be:
	sudo apt-get install php5
